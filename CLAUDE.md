# Claude Code Guidelines

## Git Workflow Rules

- Always ask for explicit user approval before committing any changes or pushing to remote
- Push changes to the original feature branches only. Do not push changes under `claude/*` branches
- Always push changes on behalf of the repository owner (rudkodm <rudko.d.v@gmail.com>). There should be no mentions of Claude as a co-author anywhere
